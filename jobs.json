We\u2019re looking for another front-end engineer to help us build more awesome tools for data teams and developers.This is a full-time position based in Ho Chi Minh City with flexible, hybrid WFH/WFO setup.Our application\u2019s architectureTo get a taste of how working with us is like, here are some insights into how our application has been built so far.The Holistics app works by allowing data analysts to connect to their data warehouses and develop reusable \u201cdata models\u201d. This allows non-technical users to use a friendly drag-and-drop interface to explore the data and build dashboards, without the need to bother their technical colleagues.On the frontend side, Vue.js 3.0 with TypeScript is our framework of choice for front-end development. To deal with displaying huge amount of data, we build sophisticated, custom Vue components that lazily render the data. Since many complex computation are done on the front-end, we also use Web workers to decouple those computation from the main rendering thread. This enables smoother user experience while also decoupling computation from rendering logic.Most of our \u201cas-code\u201d features operate in dual modes: code-mode and UI-mode. The code is for technical-savvy users, while the UI mode is for those who prefer a more intuitive start. To support these features, we have developed our own compiler and a web-based editor, similar to a lightweight version of VSCode, both of which are optimized for performance in the browser environment.On the backend side, Holistics is built using Ruby on Rails as the main web framework. Unlike standard Rails project structure, we modularize the code base into local gems and  to improve maintainability and extensibility, following . This also follows the pattern of \u201c with the gems being mostly functional/stateless code and engines handle the imperative/stateful part of the app.By using  to add static typing on top of Ruby, we ensure that most of our Ruby code has annotated type signature. This not only reduces a whole swath of common bugs that plague Ruby codebases but also significantly improves developer productivity through IDE/editor integrations.We use PostgreSQL for our main production database due to its reliability and rich feature-set. We have built a , which are then executed using Sidekiq on top of Redis.What you\u2019ll work on hereHere are some interesting engineering projects that have been going on inside HolisticsBuild a web-based IDE for data analysts to explore and develop analytics logicBuild front-end components that can render hundreds of thousand of data pointsBuild custom, interactive visualization components on top of open source technologyCreate a  as part of a semantic layer to represent analytics logicBuild a text-based database for analytics metadata on top of GitCreate a  that compiles to SQLDesign and build a natural language interface for business users to explore data and view dashboardsThe way we workWe follow Spotify squad model. Our team is split into 4 squads, each (5-7 members) consisting of engineers, product managers \n designers working closely together.How we work on a new feature:Product \n Design Team spends time research the problem, talk to customers and prepare Product Discovery Doc (PDD) and Product Requirement Doc (PRD).Engineering Team then performs a Technical Research. When we have a fairly good picture of the complexity and impact, we\u2019ll start with the implementation.We do not compromise product and code quality for artificial deadline. We refactor and think about code optimization regularly. We understand the good and bad of technical debt and use them to our advantage.We employ \u201cpair programming\u201d practices regularly where two team members work on a task together in one workstation. This brings a great deal of benefits, among which are faster knowledge transfer, reduced bus factor, better team cohesion and improved code quality.We have a strong writing culture: Almost everything is communicated through written documents. Just as our developers write reusable codes, we write .We maintain a problem-solving culture. Everyone is strongly encouraged to have rigorous understanding of a problem, separating  as well as using  to find the most important dimensions of a problem. Solutions are deliberated over with trade-offs explicitly listed in discussion documentation. Watch  that our cofounder gave (in Vietnamese)We avoid being a . We\u2019re aware more features do not equal better product.We let team members rotate every 3-6 months. This allows them to try new things and learn different aspects of the business.Our culture stimulates continuous learning:We have a  where team members present topics they are interested in.Engineering Team organizes  as well as monthly technical workshops.Product Team has regular AMA events with external product experts\r\nYour Skills and Experience\r\nWhat we look for in youHere\u2019s our idea of a good team member fit:You should have a profound interest in the front-end domain. You deeply care about the user experience and building high-performance front-end components.You should have a strong foundation in Computer Science with good problem-solving &nbsp;ability.Experience with our technology stack not required: While it\u2019s a bonus, it\u2019s not a requirement for you to be familiar with our current technical stack. We expect you to be able to pick up these quickly on the job.You should be someone with a continuous learning \n growth mindset. You find yourself excited to learn something new as part of the work every week.Communications: Given we have a strong writing culture, you should be comfortable with communicating your ideas in English written forms.Genuine interest in the space: We\u2019d love to work with people who are genuinely interested in the product and the space we\u2019re in, someone who cares about the end-product beyond just writing the code that makes it work.Interview ProcessRound 1: Technical interview with the Engineering team (understand your skills and experiences). (Showcase your past front-end projects is highly welcome. We would love to know your approaches to solving UX challenges/performance optimization. Additionally, sharing your codes would be greatly appreciated, as it provides us with a deeper insight into your problem-solving skills and technical prowess.)\u200dRound 2: Either System Design interview or takehome assignment (offline - deadline 3 days, will be sent after Round 1)Round 3: Culture \n Behavior Interview\r\nWhy You'll Love Working Here\r\nBenefits:\ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffc\u200d\ud83d\udcbc Training \n career developmentsWeekly TED talks to expand skills and knowledge.Yearly budget to support personal and professional growth, well-beings and interest cultivations.\ud83c\udf0f Competitive salary and benefits24/7 Healthcare Insurance, Periodic Medical Checkup.Salary regular reviews, 13-month Bonus.Stock Options for high-contributing individuals.\ud83d\udc95 Awesome company policiesA flexible work culture, Regular reviews, Remote policy.14 Annual leaves/year, 14 Sick leaves/year, Children care leave policy.Weekly happy hours.
